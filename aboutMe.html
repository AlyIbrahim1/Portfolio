        <p>My Name is Aly and I am a Level 4 Student at EUE.
            <br>
            I am Studying CS Through the Goldsmith UOL Program.
            <br>
            I Have Always Had a Passion for computers and technology 
            <br>Since a Young Age, and That is The Reason I Decided to 
            <br>Persue an Education and Career in Computer Science.   
        </p>
        <p>I Aim to Learn More and Explore The Wide Fields of CS,
            <br>Even Though I am Not Yet Sure What Specific Field I Want 
            <br>To Work in Yet, I am Interested in AI and CyberSecurity and
            <br>Hope to Learn More About Them in The Future.
